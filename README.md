# Radtel RT-890 Custom Firmware

This project is an effort to improve the firmware of the Radtel RT-890 in terms of features and radio performance.

It is based on [DualTachyon's OEFW](https://github.com/OEFW-community/radtel-rt-890-oefw) which is reversed from the original Radtel 1.34 firmware.  
Thanks to him for making this possible!

## Disclaimer
This firmware is a work in progress and could be unstable; it could alter your radio and its data.  
Use at your own risk and remember to [back up your SPI memory](https://github.com/OEFW-community/RT-890-custom-firmware/wiki/SPI) before installing any custom firmware.  DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.

## Features
- All stock features: [check user's manual](https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0564/8855/8800/files/RT-890_user_manual.pdf?v=1670288968)
- RX frequency can be set from 10 to 1300 MHz (results may vary)
- SSB reception

# Open reimplementation of the Radtel RT-890 v1.34 firmware

This repository is a preservation project of the **Radtel RT-890 v1.34 firmware**. \
It is dedicated to understanding how the radio works and help developers making their own customisations/fixes/etc.
It is by no means fully understood or has all variables/functions properly named, as this is best effort only. \
As a result, this repository will not include any customisations or improvements over the original firmware.

# Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS. \
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

# Building

To build the firmware, you need to fetch the submodules and then run make:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
make
```

# Flashing

To flash the firmware:
- connect your **RT-890** with a [data cable](https://www.radtels.com/de/collections/program-cables/products/radtel-usb-programming-cable-software-download-for-radtel-rt-490-rt-10-rt12-px-888k-rt-830-two-way-radio-walkie-talkie)
- simultanously press and hold the **Side1** and **Side2** keys before turning on your radio. This enables the update mode. \
The green LED will be on when this is done correctly.
- from command line enter
   ```
   make flash
   ```
   The make script uses [RT-890-python-flasher](https://github.com/OEFW-community/RT-890-python-flasher) in a virtual python environment (with a minor [patch](external/rt_890_flasher.patch)).

   By default [/dev/ttyUSB0](Makefile#L284-L290) is used. To select a different port you can overwrite it by
   ```
   make flash FLASH_PORT=<tty-port-of-your-choice>
   ```
- (on a Windows host) download [RT-890-Flasher](https://github.com/OEFW-community/radtel-rt-890-flasher) or [RT-890-Flasher-CLI](https://github.com/OEFW-community/radtel-rt-890-flasher-cli) and follow their documentation to flash the **RT-890**.
